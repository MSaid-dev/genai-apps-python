# üß† Generative AI Applications ‚Äî IBM Certificate Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects completed as part of the [IBM Generative AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-generative-ai-engineering). Each project demonstrates practical applications of generative AI using Python, LLMs, LangChain, and cloud-native tools.
